### Overview

The goals of the analysis are:
- load ToothGrowth data and perform basic exploratory data analyses
- provide basic summary of the data
- use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose
- state your conclusions and assumptions needed for conclusions


The dataset provides data about the effect of Vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea pigs. The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C by one of the two delivery methods.


### Analysis

#### Step 1: load data & explore
```{r setup}
library(datasets)
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)

data("ToothGrowth")
df <- ToothGrowth %>%
  as_tibble()

names(df) %<>% c('tooth_length', 'supplement_type', 'daily_dose')
# I personally dislike names like 'len' and 'supp' as it's easy to forget what they mean

glimpse(df)
summary(df)

```
